generator

Simple random floating point generator
prints 32 random floating point number.
final value is calculated result.

to print result to input_float.txt, use like this.
$> ./generator > input_float.txt

converter

Simple floating point converter
reads 32 floating point number from stdin
and prints it to stdout

Final value is calculated result

to convert input_float.txt and print to input_hex.txt, use like this.
$> ./converter <input_float.txt > input_hex.txt

To generate only Hex value,

$> ./generator | ./converter > input_hex.txt

Some result value may be different from Xilinx IP result by precision lost.
In that case, please re-generate numbers.
TA assures that given samples work correctly at Xilinx IP
